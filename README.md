# Star Wars Client

This is a simple React app for ingesting the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).

## Build setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# start server
npm run start

```



## Simion Putina submission for Cuvva

Hey guys, this is only my second react project but I wanted to create a solution using redux-saga and reusable components
I loved the challenge of creating a fully dynamic table to support each of the resources from the star wars api without having to do any additional configuration on headers, data formats, etc

I look forward to your feedback!
